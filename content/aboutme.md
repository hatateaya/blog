This is my blog.

I have been known as Hatate Aya.

I am a simple person, and also a MtF. Please using "she/her" or "they" as the pronoun to me.

I have some interests in Computer Science and Touhou Project.

My mother language is Chinese. You can use Chinese, English or Esperanto to communicate with me.
